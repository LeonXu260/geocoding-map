## Installation
Make sure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). **Note: When you install NodeJS, it installs npm along with it.**

There are two folder in this repo. The first one is the client and the second one is server. 
In order to run the application in the client directory, navigate to client directory and run ```npm i``` to install all the dependencies and then ```npm run serve``` to serve up the local development.

The server directory is the same thing, navigate to the ```server``` directory and run ```npm i``` to install all the dependencies and then run ```node index.js``` to spin up the local server.
