# Geocoding App

This map app allows users to search for anything that is nearby their location. User can treat it as Google Maps.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Installation
Make sure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). **Note: When you install NodeJS, it installs npm along with it.**

There are two folder in this repo. The first one is the client and the second one is server. 
In order to run the application in the client directory, navigate to client directory and run ```npm i``` to install all the dependencies and then ```npm run serve``` to serve up the local development.

The server directory is the same thing, navigate to the ```server``` directory and run ```npm i``` to install all the dependencies and then run ```node index.js``` to spin up the local server.


## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
